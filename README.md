- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned


To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
div class="container">
  <div class="card">
    <img src="images/image-qr-code.png">
    <div class="text">
      <h2>Improve your front-end skills by building projects</h2>
      <p>Scan the QR code to visit Frontend Mentor and take your coding skills to the next level</p>
    </div>

  </div>

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```



### Continued development

i wish to enhance my knowledge further with Css and its responsive stylings. Building strong bonds with basic tags for both Html and Css. There are few other languages i look forward to learning to become a frontend developer with a difference.
